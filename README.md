The original data is from Carnegie Mellon's inventory of holdings, which is publicly available. This is a cleaned dataset focused on contemporary artists. There are two different csv files. One is the cleaned dataset. The "Gallery" dataset is designed to be used with Palladio. It contains fields with links to artist's bio and a sample image of their work. The "dms" file is a Palladio Gallery project ready for use.
